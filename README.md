# CanvasTests
Two short projects I did back in 2017 to experiment with custom animation and the HTML canvas element. I've learned better ways to approach these sorts of things since, however I thought it would be fun to back this up here for posterity.

- Grid.html: Randomly generates a grid of colored tiles based on user input. Tiles can then be filled-in (turned black) via three different animation options. Clicking on the canvas will enter into a sort of "paint mode" where every tile you hover over will fill it in (click again to stop painting). Double clicking on a tile will create a sort of cross shape that shoots out in the four cardinal directions from the clicked tile. Painting and double clicking also work while an animation is playing.

- 2048.html: A mostly functional, but incomplete, version of the 2048 mobile game. You use the arrow keys move all the blocks in the direction of your input. Combine blocks of the same color until no more blocks can be moved or you create a black block (which resets the game)
